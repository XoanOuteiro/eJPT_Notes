SUID is a specialized permission that allows users to execute binaries with the permission of the file owner as opposed to the user that is running the binary

SUID means Set Owner ID

SUID permissions are hence tipycally used to allow unprivileged users to execute specific binaries for which they may need file owner permissions.

We will tipycally target root-owned binaries.

## Lab Writeup

We can check the shared objects a file is loading using

``` bash
file [file]
```

``` bash
string [file]
```

To see what its loading

We can see with strings its loading a binary named "greetings"

We can now for example delete greetings and create a copy of bash named similarly:

``` bash
rm greetings
cp /bin/bash greetings
```

Now because welcome calls greeting with roots privileges when we run welcome with ./welcome we will instantly get a root bash session.
