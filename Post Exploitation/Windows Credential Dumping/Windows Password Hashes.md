Hashed user account passwords are stored locally in the [[SAM (Security Accounts Manager)]] database.

Authentication and verification of credentials is facilitated by the Local Security Authority (LSA)

Windows versions up to windows server 2003 utilize:
- LM Hashes
- NTLM Hashes

Since Windows Vista LM Hashing has been disabled

You WILL NEED an elevated session in orther to dump hashes

LM (LanMan) is the default hashing algorithm that was implemented in Windows systems prior to NT4.0

The protocol is used to hash user passwords and the hashing process can be broken down into:

- Password is broken into two seven-char chunks
- All chars are then converted into uppercase
- Each chunk is then hashed separately with the DES algo

---

NTLM (NTHash) is a collection of authentication protocols that are utilized by Windows to facilitate authentication between computers. The authentication process involves using a valid username and password to authenticate succesfully.

When a user account in created it is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm.

NTLM improves LM in:
- Does not split password into chunks
- Case sensitive
- Allows use of symbols and unicode characters
