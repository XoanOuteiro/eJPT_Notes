Related to [[Windows Vulnerabilities]] and [[Metasploit]] as well as [[Active Recon]]

We run usual [[Active Recon]] to gather info about the target

We can search for exploits using the exact versions of the services we discover (with the search type:exploit command)
To check if it will work on an specific version we may ccheck it with command info after choosing with use

We could also user searchsploit to automatically search exploitDB

``` bash
searchsploit "[term]"
```

To get specific metasploit modules we can grep

``` bash
searchsploit "[term]" | grep -e "Metasploit"
```

The autopwn plugin is also very useful
To install download it and move it into /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/
Then run:

``` bash
load db_autopwn
```

In msfconsole, then we can use it with:

``` bash
db_autopwn -p -t -PI [portRangeForScan]
```

We can also use analyze, and see detected vulns using the vulns command.
