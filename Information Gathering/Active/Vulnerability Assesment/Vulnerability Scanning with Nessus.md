Nessus is developed by Tenable, its propietary software.

We will use nessus esentials which is free and allows 16 IP scans for free.

You need to create an account for an activation code

It's installed via dpkg, then we need to start the service:

``` bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

We can the go into it via a browser using localhost and the nessus port (usually 8834)

It will ask us to create an admin account

Nessus is CLI based which makes it very simple to use

The new scan area is mostly self explanatory.

Once we click on a scan we can see the vulnerabilities tab to examine all known vulns, we can change the filters to browse more efficiently

The from [[Metasploit]] we can import the scan results:

``` bash
db_import [path_to_nessus_output]
```

We can use the CVE code from each discovered vuln to obtain exploits

``` bash
search cve:[year] name:[name]
```

We can also check per port:

``` bash
search -p [port]
```
