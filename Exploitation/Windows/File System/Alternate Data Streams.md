Also known as ADS, it's an NTFS file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS

A file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams:
- Data Stream: Default stream that contains the data of the file
- Resource Stream: Typically contains the metadata of the file

Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious codes or executables in legitimate files in order to evade detection

Can be done bby storing malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource stream (metadata) of a legitimate file


As an example we can create a fille named test.txt and hide secret.txt inside it

``` bash
notepad text.txt:secret.txt
```

And we will be hidden within the secret.txt file, to access the hidden file again:

``` bash
notepad text.txt:secret.txt
```

We can for example hide WinPEAS inside a normal file:

``` bash
type WinPEAS.exe > windowslog.txt:WinPEAS.exe
```

Then to run it, first we need to create a symbolic link:

``` bash
cd \
cd Windows\System32
mklink wupdate.exe C:\\Temp\windowslog.txt:WinPEAS.exe
```

Now when we run wupdate, WinPEAS will run. This can also be used for [[Metasploit]] msfvenom payloads.
