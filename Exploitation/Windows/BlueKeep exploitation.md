CVE-2019-0708, it's an RDP vulnerability in WIndows that could allow attackers to remotly execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system.

It affects XP, Vista, Windows 7,  Windows Server 2008 and R2. Tho a patch exists and is widely implemented

BlueKeep has plenty PoC's that may be malitious in nature, so one must be careful when using these exploits.

We can use [[Metasploit]] to see if a system is vulnerable and for exploitation

Targeting kernel memory space may cause crashes

``` bash
sudo nmap -p 3389 [IP]
```

``` bash
sudo postgresql start && msfconsole
```

``` bash
search bluekeep
```

Here we can use the auxiliary for scanning.

Then we can use the exploit, we may need to modify the chunk size according to target RAM

You may need to change target which is done via "search targets" and "set targets (num)"
