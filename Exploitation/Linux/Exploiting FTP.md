See [[FTP Enumeration]] and [[Metasploit]] aswell as [[Linux Exploitation]]

Mostly the only way to exploit FTP is either via an inherent version vuln or to use FTP enumeration to discover accesible users and shares.

We may also use anonymous access with anonymous:anonymous creds or metasploit anonymous scanner module.

Tipycally we will perform a bruteforce, hydra is the best tool for this:

``` bash
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt [rIP] -t [threads] [protol (ftp)]
```

Then we login to accounts as usual via:

``` bash
ftp [rIP]
```
